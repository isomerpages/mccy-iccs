<p>The Southeast Asia Social Cohesion Radar was first launched in 2022. The
maiden edition was a modest attempt at understanding the nature of social
cohesion across ASEAN against a changing and varying cultural and physical
regional landscape. Conducted under pandemic conditions, the study tapped
into the perspectives of 1,000 thought leaders across Southeast Asia (i.e.,
100 from each country) to explore their views on social cohesion in their
country and the region. The key findings are featured in this video:</p>

<p>The second edition, to be launched in 2025, is an enhanced version with
significant changes made to the methodology and overall research design
to strengthen the rigor of the study. The 2025 edition surveys 10,000 members
of the general population across ASEAN (i.e. 1,000 per country), ensuring
a more comprehensive and citizen-centred understanding of social cohesion.
Beyond survey responses, the 2025 study will incorporate complementary
data sources such as interviews with subject matter and country experts,
macro indicators as well as social listening data.</p>
