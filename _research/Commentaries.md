<p>Singapore’s evolving multicultural and multireligious fabric presents
opportunities and challenges for social cohesion. Recent findings from
the 2024 Institute of Policy Studies Survey reveal a paradox: younger Singaporeans
expect a more cohesive society yet at the same time view that discrimination
is on the rise, signalling a trust deficit that should be addressed. Sustained
engagement amongst the different communities is key to fostering deep connections,
mutual respect, and an enduring sense of belonging.</p>

<p>In an increasingly fragmented world, the importance of dialogue in bridging
divides cannot be understated. Indeed, interfaith and inter-ethnic dialogue
has been consistently touted as the primary means of promoting understanding
and acceptance among different communities in Singapore. However, as our
identities and affiliations extend beyond race and religion, we must consider
whether our efforts at dialogue should become more inclusive and all-encompassing.
Instead of speaking merely of interfaith and inter-ethnic dialogue, it
is possible to complement this with an intercultural lens that would allow
us to cover any potential blind spots.</p>

<p>Societies across the world are tested by the COVID-19 pandemic in countless
ways. Deep cracks in social cohesion have become visible in many countries,
and many fall along religious lines. Post-COVID-19 policy needs to address
robustly what inclusion means both for government policy and for each society.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church has been at the leading edge of interreligious dialogue
since the 1960s. Combined with its focus on social teachings, it is important
to reflect on what this – the largest Christian denomination – has contributed
to cohesion and welfare both in Singapore and globally.</p>

<p>'Many Communities, One Shared Future' was the theme of the recently concluded
International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS). A key takeaway is
that diversity is not a hindrance to social cohesion; it is how people
manage the difference. It is also important that everyone plays a part
and not wait for the government or institutions to do something.</p>

<p>Singapore’s commitment to multiracialism and inter-faith harmony is not
just about keeping the peace but about its identity as a nation. It has
achieved much over the last 50 years but serious challenges remain. The
speed in which fake news and hate speech are spread online can easily create
enmity among the races and religious groups. Much depends on whether Singaporeans
are merely tolerant of each other or have developed deep trust and understanding.</p>
