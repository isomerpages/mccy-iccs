The Singapore Jain Religious Society (SJRS) is located at 18 Jln Yasin. SJRS was formed in 1972 and registered as a religious society. In 1978, the building at 18 Jln Yasin was built and has since become the place where the Jain community conduct their festivities, functions and classes.

SJRS conducts free religious classes for the young (ages 4 to 12). They also have a Youth Wing, Ladies Wing and Senior Wing. These individual wings conduct their own activities and initiatives for the Jain community in Singapore.

Apart from its various initiatives, SJRS has been active in its community efforts. SJRS partners with Sunlove as well as other organisations for the Jain community to give back to the community. SJRS is also a part of the Kembangan-Chai Chee IRCC and has supported the IRCC in various events.
