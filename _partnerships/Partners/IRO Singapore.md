The IRO was formed in 1949 by religious leaders from different faiths, with a timeless purpose to achieve harmony of faiths in Singapore. IRO has since been growing interfaith ties in Singapore, and nurturing inter-religious connections for over 70 years. Religious freedom is truly unique in Singapore, where all religious groups are able to practice without persecution from any majority faith. Through keeping multi-faith harmony, the people in Singapore have inter-religious peace, awareness of other religious practices and understanding of different customs or ways of worship.
