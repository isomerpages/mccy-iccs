The inaugural International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS) took place from 19 to 21 June 2019 at the Raffles City Convention Centre. 

Centred around the theme of ***“Many Communities, One Shared Future”***, ICCS 2019 provided a vital platform for conversations on forging stronger interfaith understanding and developing new ideas to foster greater harmony in societies. Close to 1,200 participants from about 40 countries attended ICCS 2019, with many workshops and plenary sessions aimed at engaging a diverse range of audiences.

The Conference discussed themes of building social cohesion and interfaith harmony, bringing together international thought leaders across academia, government, religious groups and the civic sector. Such conversations are critical, especially in a world where identity politics is growing, where societies are fracturing along the lines of race, religion, class and nationality, and where communities are trying to heal from discord and strife.
