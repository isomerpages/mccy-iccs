The book aims to promote greater understanding of social cohesion amidst existing complexities of faith and identity, and what this portends for our future. The emphasis is on the importance of engagement across beliefs and cultures, the different generations and segments of population, and the diverse interests of people in a digital and interconnected world. The policy officials, religious leaders, scholars and society-at-large will be able to better appreciate the search for common ground and harmony, thereby strengthening their endeavours for coexistence.

The book seeks to continue the conversations and deliberations at the International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS) held from 19 to 21 June 2019 in Singapore. The three themes of the ICCS — Faith, Identity, Cohesion — stimulated significant discussions on the need for mutual respect, trust and understanding of each other’s beliefs and cultures. Many ideas on the ways forward were raised and further discourse is necessary.

An unprecedented line-up of academic, civil society, government, intellectual, policy, religious and youth leaders provided a wide array of perspectives on challenging issues faced by diverse societies around the world. The transcripts of the official speeches elucidate the vision of leadership and aspiration looking ahead. The book also features delightful photographs and graphic recordings of the key thrust articulated during the ICCS.
