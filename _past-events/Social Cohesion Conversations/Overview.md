The Social Cohesion Conversations is a webinar series aimed at encouraging conversations among policymakers, community and religious leaders, and practitioners from Asia and beyond. Key themes of the series include how we build social harmony and cohesive societies.

The first webinar of this series took place on 11 February 2022 via a video conference, focused on the topic of interfaith relations and collaborations during a global pandemic. The invited speakers were Cambodian Ambassador to Japan Pou Sothirak and Roses of Peace founder  , and  will be moderated by Dr Paul Hedges, Associate Professor in interreligious studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore.
4            I would like to invite you to speak at this first webinar session on regional cooperation efforts in response to COVID-19 in Southeast Asia, and how differences and competing interests from different communities can be reconciled for the common good. Your experience and expertise as a policymaker and senior research fellow at Singaporeâ€™s Institute of Southeast Asia Studies (ISEAS) will help to establish the regional context and provide valuable insights to this topic. This webinar will also feature two other speakers who will share their experience in this topic. You may refer to the attached Annex for more information on this webinar.
