<p>The ICCS Inter-Sessional Event, titled "Inspiring Cohesive and Resilient
Societies", is designed to maintain momentum between the larger International
Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS). This gathering, scheduled for
24 to 26 September 2024, will bring together approximately 100 religious
and community practitioners, academics, researchers, and policymakers from
around the world. The Inter-Sessional Event aims to deepen our understanding
of social cohesion challenges, share best practices, and develop potential
solutions. Participants can look forward to a series of lectures, panel
discussions, skills workshops, breakout sessions, and opportunities for
networking and community engagement.</p>
<h3>Programme Synopsis</h3>
<h4><strong>Day 1</strong></h4>
<p>Day 1 is designed to welcome delegates as well as foster networking and
socialising to create a casual, collaborative atmosphere. Dr Richard Wike
will provide a keynote on emerging global trends impacting plural societies.
As part of community engagement, delegates will enjoy a showcase presentation
by a big technology firm where they will learn about the firm's role in
moderating divisive content online. The day will conclude with dinner at
Lau Pa Sat, offering an immersive experience of Singaporean food culture.</p>
<h4><strong>Day 2</strong></h4>
<p>Day 2 aims to help delegates understand the social cohesion landscape
from various perspectives by exploring the different causes of societal
division. Prof Mona Siddiqui will share insights from her research in interreligious
relations, highlighting key challenges that multicultural societies face
in fostering social cohesion. A panel discussion, moderated by Dr Paul
Hedges and featuring Ms Wu Ye-Min and Mr Shukul Raaj Kumar, will delve
into potential causes of societal division, such as race, religion, and
rising polarisation. Delegates will also join breakout groups to learn
futures planning and identify emerging issues that may impact community
dynamics. In the evening, delegates will be brought to a heritage district
which showcases Singapore’s cultural spaces. The Religious Rehabilitation
Group will host delegates to a dinner where they will talk about their
work and role in fostering social cohesion in Singapore.​</p>
<h4><strong>Day 3</strong></h4>
<p>While Day 2 focused on the concept of 'divide,' Day 3 will emphasize 'unity.'
This day is dedicated to generating actionable solutions for social cohesion
issues. Dr Leong Chan-Hoong will moderate a panel discussion featuring
Prof Toshiaki Sasao and Dr Selvaraj Velayutham, who will both share best
practices for fostering mutual understanding within diverse communities.
Delegates will then engage in their respective breakout groups to learn
conflict resolution skills and develop concrete action plans for addressing
social cohesion challenges. Following this, they will present their work
to the larger group. The Inter-Sessional Event will conclude with a reflective
session, inviting delegates to contribute ideas for future editions of
the ICCS.</p>
<h3>Speakers (Day 1)</h3>
<h4><strong>In Conversation with Guest Speaker</strong></h4>
<p><strong>"Harmony Across Cultures - Unveiling Global Social Cohesion Trends"&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>This keynote speech explores emerging global trends impacting plural societies.
Drawing from cross-country comparative studies, it highlights common challenges
arising from increasing diversity worldwide. Additionally, it examines
seemingly contradictory trends, such as the simultaneous rise of non-religion
and growing religiosity, offering insights into the understanding and interpretation
of these trends. The session concludes with an interactive conversation
to delve deeper into these themes. By the end of this session, delegates
will have a broad overview of the major trends emerging in plural societies

<h3>Speakers (Day 2)</h3>
<h4><strong>In Conversation with Guest Speaker</strong></h4>
<p><strong>"Inclusive Unity - Addressing Challenges to Social Cohesion in Plural Societies"&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>This address by Prof Mona Siddiqui explores the key challenges of fostering
social cohesion in multicultural societies.&nbsp; Drawing upon her extensive
body of work in Islamic studies and inter-religious relations, she examines
the broad key drivers leading to societal division and polarisation in
contemporary plural societies. Using both regional and global examples,
she then illustrates the ways various factors have interacted and intersected
to cause fissures and divides in multicultural contexts. The conversation
after the session considers possible means to alleviate such divisions.
After this session, it is hoped that delegates will&nbsp;have&nbsp;a nuanced
comprehension of the ways divides evolve in multicultural societies.</p>

exercise. Using this framework, delegates will engage in breakout discussions
to assess the current landscape and identify critical emerging issues for
social cohesion. These activities will help delegates contextualise the
discussions from previous lectures and panel sessions. It is hoped that
delegates will be able to apply the concept of futures planning in the
work they are engaged in within their respective communities.</p>
