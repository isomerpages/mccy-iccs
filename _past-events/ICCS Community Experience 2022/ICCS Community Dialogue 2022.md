The ICCS 2022 Community Dialogue took place on 5 Sep 2022, one day before ICCS, at Wisma Geylang Serai.

It explored key constructs, impact models and ground-up approaches on questions such as: how can we be inclusive and build bridges between different communities in an increasingly complex and diverse social landscape, and how can we inspire change for the better.
