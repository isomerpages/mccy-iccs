The first webinar of this series took place on 11 February 2022 via a video conference, focused on the topic of interfaith relations and collaborations during a global pandemic. The invited speakers were Cambodian Ambassador to Japan Pou Sothirak and Roses of Peace founder Abbas Ali Mohamed Irshad. The session was moderated by Dr Paul Hedges, Associate Professor in Interreligious Studies at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore.
