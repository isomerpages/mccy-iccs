# Synopsis
This plenary critically examines the reasons for the rise and endurance of social polarisation due to ideological or religious beliefs. With a stronger understanding of these divides and the reasons behind them, we hope that some of the lessons gleaned can be applied to foster inter-religious peace and harmony in plural societies across the region and beyond. Specific lessons from faith traditions are shared.
