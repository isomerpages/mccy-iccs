# Zoroastrian House
![](/images/Places%20of%20Worship/photo_zoroastrian%20house%202.jpg)

The Zoroastrian House (ZH), inaugurated in 2011, was contributed by Homiyar Vasania, a prominent member of the Zoroastrian community in Singapore. ZH is the only prayer hall for Parsis in Singapore and also serves as home to the Parsi Zoroastrian Association of Southeast Asia (PZAS).

The premise is used for various purposes by the community, primarily Sunday prayers every week by the in-house religious worker. This premise is not synonymous with the Fire Temple (an official place of worship for the Zoroastrians). There is no Fire Temple in Singapore and worship is conducted in private settings.

![](/images/Places%20of%20Worship/photo_zoroastrian%20house%205.jpg)

Contrary to popular belief, Zoroastrians are not fire worshippers, rather they see fire in a more symbolic way as representing God's light or wisdom.

While the community is about only 350 members strong, the contributions of the Zoroastrians to Singapore's progress and cultural development have been significant.
