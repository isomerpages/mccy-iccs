# Sentosa Island
![](/images/Sentosa.jpg)

Before it was known as Sentosa, this island just off Singapore’s southern coast was a British military fortress. After the Japanese Occupation in World War II, Singapore returned to British rule, and the island was renamed “Sentosa” which means “peace and tranquility” in Malay. 

Over the course of its remarkable history, Sentosa has transformed into a beloved island resort, best known for its tropical beaches, luxurious hotels and thrilling attractions. Whether you’re looking for an adrenaline rush or a day of relaxing in the sun, Sentosa is bound to enchant and delight.

# Singapore Zoo
Located on the north-western side of the island, the Singapore Zoo is a haven for wondrous wildlife and a must-visit for animal lovers.

This beloved establishment first opened its gates to the public in 1973, and has since become one of the best rainforest zoos in the world.

Besides being home to over 2,800 animals from 300 species—including crocodiles, Malayan tapirs and white tigers—the zoo has won a trove of international and local awards.
