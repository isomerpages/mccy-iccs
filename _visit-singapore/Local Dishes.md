# Chicken Rice
![](/images/Chicken%20Rice.jpg)

When you see succulent cooked chicken hanging neatly in a row at a food stall, you are looking at one of the nation's favourite dishes—Hainanese Chicken Rice.

A ubiquitous sight in [hawker centres](https://www.visitsingapore.com/editorials/the-street-food-of-singapore/) across the country, it is also on the menu in many major restaurants and even hotel cafés. All offer the same dish at varying prices: bite-sized slices of chicken—or a whole chicken if you’re eating as a big group—served with fragrant rice, spicy chilli and ginger paste.

# Roti Prata

Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, _roti prata_ hits the spot every time. A South-Indian flat bread made by frying stretched dough flavoured with _ghee_ (Indian clarified butter), it is usually served with fish or mutton curry.

_Roti_ means 'bread', and _prata_ or _paratha_ means 'flat' in Hindi. Some believe the dish evolved from original pancake recipes from Punjab in India, but across the causeway in Malaysia, the flat bread is called _roti canai_, which some say is a nod to its origins from Chennai.

No matter where it comes from, _roti prata_ is a satisfying meal for any hour of the day. While the classic versions are served plain or with eggs as a filling, local menus now feature a variety of modern variations such as cheese, chocolate, ice-cream, and even durians – turning it from a main course to a dessert.

# Nasi Lemak

Translate _nasi lemak_ from Malay to English, and you will get 'rich rice'. The ‘rich’ refers not to wealth, but the coconut cream that makes it oh-so sinfully scrumptious.

This dish is a perfect mix of flavours: aromatic rice infused with coconut milk and pandan leaves, eaten with deep-fried fish or chicken wings, _otah_ (grilled fish paste), fried _ikan bilis_ (local anchovies) and peanuts, eggs, cucumber slices, and _sambal_ (spicy chilli paste).

It is a hearty meal that is adored by the [Malays](https://www.visitsingapore.com/en_au/travel-guide-tips/about-singapore/people-of-singapore/) as well as non-Malays who have their own version of nasi lemak. The rice is the same, although some have a greenish hue owing to the pandan leaves, but it is the side dishes that set each other apart.

The [Chinese](https://www.visitsingapore.com/en_au/travel-guide-tips/about-singapore/people-of-singapore/) version, for instance, can come with anything from deep fried drumstick, chicken franks and fish cake to curried vegetables and luncheon meat.

# Rojak
![](/images/Rojak.jpg)

_Rojak_ means an “eclectic mix” in colloquial [Malay](https://www.visitsingapore.com/en_au/travel-guide-tips/about-singapore/people-of-singapore/), and the dish sure lives up to its name. Its ingredients reflect the cultural diversity of Singapore, bringing together disparate items with strong flavours into a harmoniously tasty blend.

It is a local salad of mixed vegetables, fruits, and dough fritters that is covered in a sticky black sauce and garnished with chopped peanuts and finely-cut fragrant ginger flowers for a piquant taste.

The mark of a good _rojak_ is its sauce, made up of fermented prawn paste, sugar, lime and chilli paste. It must be an appetising mix of sweet, sour and spicy.
