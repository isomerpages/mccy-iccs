# Chicken Rice
![](/images/Chicken%20Rice.jpg)

When you see succulent cooked chicken hanging neatly in a row at a food stall, you are looking at one of the nation's favourite dishes—Hainanese Chicken Rice.

A ubiquitous sight in [hawker centres](https://www.visitsingapore.com/editorials/the-street-food-of-singapore/) across the country, it is also on the menu in many major restaurants and even hotel cafés. All offer the same dish at varying prices: bite-sized slices of chicken—or a whole chicken if you’re eating as a big group—served with fragrant rice, spicy chilli and ginger paste.

# Roti Prata

Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, _roti prata_ hits the spot every time. A South-Indian flat bread made by frying stretched dough flavoured with _ghee_ (Indian clarified butter), it is usually served with fish or mutton curry.

_Roti_ means 'bread', and _prata_ or _paratha_ means 'flat' in Hindi. Some believe the dish evolved from original pancake recipes from Punjab in India, but across the causeway in Malaysia, the flat bread is called _roti canai_, which some say is a nod to its origins from Chennai.

No matter where it comes from, _roti prata_ is a satisfying meal for any hour of the day. While the classic versions are served plain or with eggs as a filling, local menus now feature a variety of modern variations such as cheese, chocolate, ice-cream, and even durians – turning it from a main course to a dessert.
