# Chicken Rice
![](/images/Chicken%20Rice.jpg)

When you see succulent cooked chicken hanging neatly in a row at a food stall, you are looking at one of the nation's favourite dishes—Hainanese Chicken Rice.

A ubiquitous sight in [hawker centres](https://www.visitsingapore.com/editorials/the-street-food-of-singapore/) across the country, it is also on the menu in many major restaurants and even hotel cafés. All offer the same dish at varying prices: bite-sized slices of chicken—or a whole chicken if you’re eating as a big group—served with fragrant rice, spicy chilli and ginger paste.
