</div>
<p>Historically one of Singapore’s oldest urban quarters,&nbsp;<a href="https://visitkamponggelam.com.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kampong Gelam</a>&nbsp;is
a neighbourhood where age-old traditions and trendy lifestyle come together
in a heady blend.</p>
<p>The word ‘kampong’ means “compound in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/about-singapore/people-of-singapore/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Malay</a>,
while “gelam” refers to the long-leaved paperbark tree, commonly found
in the area and used for boat-making, medicine and even as a seasoning
for food.</p>
<p>The district has a history that dates back to Singapore’s colonial era,
when Sir Stamford Raffles allocated the area to the Malay, Arab and Bugis
communities. Since then, the area has evolved into a haunt for hip travellers
and connoisseurs of culture alike.</p>

<p>Little India is a buzzing historic area that shows off the best of Singapore’s
Indian community, from vibrant culture to incredible shopping.</p>
<p>You may not know that Little India once had a racecourse, cattle herders
and brick kilns.</p>
<p>But while these places and people are gone, time stands still in pockets
of this historic district.</p>
<p>Olden-day trades sit next to newer businesses: flower-garland vendors,
modern eateries, boutique hotels, as well as arts groups.</p>
