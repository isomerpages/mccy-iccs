Historically one of Singapore’s oldest urban quarters, [Kampong Gelam](https://visitkamponggelam.com.sg/) is a neighbourhood where age-old traditions and trendy lifestyle come together in a heady blend.

The word ‘kampong’ means “compound in [Malay](https://www.visitsingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/about-singapore/people-of-singapore/), while “gelam” refers to the long-leaved paperbark tree, commonly found in the area and used for boat-making, medicine and even as a seasoning for food.

The district has a history that dates back to Singapore’s colonial era, when Sir Stamford Raffles allocated the area to the Malay, Arab and Bugis communities. Since then, the area has evolved into a haunt for hip travellers and connoisseurs of culture alike.

Little India is a buzzing historic area that shows off the best of Singapore’s Indian community, from vibrant culture to incredible shopping.

You may not know that Little India once had a racecourse, cattle herders and brick kilns.

But while these places and people are gone, time stands still in pockets of this historic district.

Olden-day trades sit next to newer businesses: flower-garland vendors, modern eateries, boutique hotels, as well as arts groups.
