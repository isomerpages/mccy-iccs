The Bahá'í community in Singapore gather for prayers and activities at the Bahá'í Centre. The Centre is presently located at 55 Cantonment Road and nestled within a row of shops that was constructed in 1819 during the British Colonialism. Apart from the Centre, Bahá'ís also invite their family, friends, and neighbours to their homes for worship and fellowship.

The Centre is also the administrative centre of the Bahá'í Faith in Singapore. The Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Singapore guides and co-ordinates the activities of the Local Spiritual Assemblies and individual members of the Bahá'í community.

Inspired by the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith, the community also actively contributes to strengthening social harmony in Singapore by participating in interfaith activities that broaden mutual understanding and facilitate inter-community interaction.
