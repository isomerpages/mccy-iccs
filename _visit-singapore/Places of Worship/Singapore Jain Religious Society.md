<p>The Singapore Jain Religious Society (SJRS) is located at 18 Jln Yasin.
SJRS was formed in 1972 and registered as a religious society. In 1978,
the building at 18 Jln Yasin was built and has since become the place where
the Jain community conduct their festivities, functions and classes.</p>
<p>SJRS conducts free religious classes for the young (ages 4 to 12). They
also have a Youth Wing, Ladies Wing and Senior Wing. These individual wings
conduct their own activities and initiatives for the Jain community in
Singapore.</p>
