Maghain Aboth Synagogue (MAS) is the oldest surviving synagogue in Southeast Asia, and is one of Singapore's two synagogues, the other being Chesed-El Synagogue. The name of the synagogue means "Shield of Our Fathers" in Hebrew. MAS is a testament to the contributions of the small but close-knit Jewish community in Singapore since the colonial era.

Gazetted a national monument in 1998, MAS has been a meeting place of the Jewish community for weekly Sabbath services and religious festivals such as Rosh Hashanah,Yom Kippur (Jewish New Year's Day) and the Passover.

The premise houses the newly established Jews of Singapore Museum, which is open to public, as well as a kosher shop and a restaurant.

The synagogues have further added colour and detail to Singapore's growing multi-ethnic community.
