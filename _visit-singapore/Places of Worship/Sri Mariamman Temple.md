Sri Mariamman Temple (SMT) is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. The temple was constructed for worship by immigrants from the Nagapatnam and Cuddalore districts of South India. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Mariamman, known for her healing powers in curing diseases and illnesses.

Located in Chinatown, the building of SMT was the inspiration of Mr Naraina Pillai, a clerk with the British East India Company who is known to have accompanied Sir Stamford Raffles (Founder of Singapore) on his visit to the island.

Gazetted a national monument in 1973, SMT is well-known for holding the annual Firewalking Festival, which falls in October or November.

The temple is nestled between Jamae Chulia Mosque and Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, adding vibrancy to the multiracial and multireligious fabric of Singapore.
