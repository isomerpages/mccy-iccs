Sultan Mosque is a prominent landmark in the Kampong Glam Malay Heritage District. The mosque is named after Sultan Hussain Shah, Ruler of Temasek (former name of Singapore) who has proposed to build a mosque to Sir Stamford Raffles, who then contributed 3000 Spanish dollars from the British East India Company towards the mosque's building fund.

Gazetted a national monument in 1975, the mosque can hold up to 5000 congregants in its two-storey hall. The mosque's architectural style is influenced by the Indo-Saracenic style, which combines traditional Indian and Islamic elements with European features.

In the past, the mosque served as a stopover for Muslim pilgrims from the region on their Hajj (pilgrimage to the Islamic holy city, Mecca).

The rich heritage and architecture of the mosque add to the cultural diversity that Singapore houses.
