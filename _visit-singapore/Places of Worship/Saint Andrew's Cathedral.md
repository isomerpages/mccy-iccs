St Andrew's Cathedral (SAC) is the oldest Anglican place of worship in Singapore and was gazetted a national monument in 1973. The cathedral is named after Saint Andrew, the Patron of Scotland, to honour the Scottish community who had donated generously to the building fund. Featuring a neo-Gothic architectural style, the construction of the building was carried out by Indian convict labourers. The cathedral can accommodate up to 300 seated worshippers.

It is believed that the land to build the church was donated by Singapore's first Arab settler, Syed Sharif Omar bin Ali Al-Junied, a trader and landowner.

SAC remains an important place of worship for the Anglican community and conducts services in many languages.

SAC has been active in the local community scene such as being involved in Adopt a Block in the Community project in the Bukit Merah area and befriending migrant workers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
