</div>
<p>Before it was known as Sentosa, this island just off Singapore’s southern
coast was a British military fortress. After the Japanese Occupation in
World War II, Singapore returned to British rule, and the island was renamed
“Sentosa” which means “peace and tranquility” in Malay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of its remarkable history, Sentosa has transformed into
a beloved island resort, best known for its tropical beaches, luxurious
hotels and thrilling attractions. Whether you’re looking for an adrenaline
rush or a day of relaxing in the sun, Sentosa is bound to enchant and delight.</p>

<p>It’s hard to miss the sprawling 101-hectare lot right by the water in
Marina Bay. Two huge futuristic structures rise out of the greenery at
Gardens by the Bay, which was designed with environmental sustainability
in mind.</p>
<p>These are the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest cooled conservatories,
which was listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records as the world’s largest
glass greenhouse. The freestanding unsupported glass roofs enclose expansive
spaces, unmarred by any pillar or column.</p>
<p>Besides ultra-modern design, the conservatories also use cutting-edge
technologies for better energy efficiency.</p>

<p>The latest jewel in Singapore's art crown, the National Gallery Singapore
is a visual arts institution housing an unparalleled collection of modern
Singapore and Southeast Asian art.</p>
<p>Fittingly located in the heart of the Civic District, the Gallery is housed
in the City Hall and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/architecture/historical/old-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">former Supreme Court</a>—two
iconic buildings that have played a monumental role in Singapore's history.
Utmost care was taken to ensure that preservation guidelines for these
two national monuments were being upheld even as they were being remodelled
into a state-of-the-art museum for the public.</p>
