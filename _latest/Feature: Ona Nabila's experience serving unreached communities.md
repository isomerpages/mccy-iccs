For many delegates and speakers, ICCS 2022 was a remarkable experience that introduced new approaches to fostering social cohesion within our communities. There were horizons broadened, friendships forged and experiences gained. One of our delegates was Dr. Ona Nabila, a doctor and clinic coordinator serving in remote and under-served regions in Indonesia with doctorSHARE. She shares more about her personal journey and her takeaways from ICCS 2022:

**Tell us more about doctorSHARE, as well as your experience as a doctor serving unreached communities.**

I’m a women and children’s health specialist, based on Kei Island in the Southeast Maluku islands and have served with doctorSHARE since 2021. Officially established in 2009, doctorSHARE is a non-profit organisation focusing on medical healthcare services and humanitarian aid for unreached communities across Indonesia’s vast archipelago. 

Since its inception, we have served almost 70,000 patients with a diverse range of medical needs.
We also have a floating hospital; a tuberculosis clinic in Sentani Lake, Papua; a women and children’s clinic in Kei Island, Southeast Maluku; and a new clinic under construction in Nias Island, North Sumatra.

My time with doctorSHARE has impressed upon me the existing challenges that many communities face. A recent memory was having to send a patient with dengue fever to a hospital in another island 2 hours away by boat. We had to brave choppy waters! Thankfully, we managed to get the patient over there in time to receive medical attention.

As some of these villages have long-standing rivalries among themselves, there have been violent skirmishes with machetes and arrows between them, with some causing terrible casualties. I remember us doctors almost being caught in between one of these skirmishes, if not for the protection of the Indonesian Armed Forces stationed close by.

**What are some of the most challenging aspects about your work on the field? Have there been tough moments?**

A significant challenge are the geographical and material issues that affect these communities. We serve in remote areas, which means that these areas tend to be difficult to travel to and lack proper healthcare facilities.

There are also challenges arising from socioeconomic factors such as long-held traditions as well as the low wages received by rural residents. While villagers generally receive our medical services enthusiastically, it is not as easy to get communities to adopt new habits that might need significant relearning. 

A case in point is when villagers practice subsistence farming of crops with low nutritional value. While there was initial reluctance to embrace new approaches, we managed to introduce a new garden with low-cost and high-nutrition crops, and shared ideas on how to maintain this garden with the villagers.

**Tell us more about your work with the Interfaith Center of New York (ICNY), including some key milestones and some of the challenges/trends you're observing in the US.**

I am the Director of Community Partnerships at the ICNY, a secular non-profit organisation with a mission to overcome prejudice, violence and misunderstanding by activating the power of the city’s grassroots religious and civic leaders and their communities. I also plan, implement and facilitate ICNY’s flagship conference, the Rabbi Marshall T. Meyer Retreat on Social Justice annually. 

In fact, we recently completed our 40th Retreat on Housing Now: Faith Communities’ Call to Action. This conference explored the important relationship between faith leaders and housing advocacy in New York City. It presented an opportunity for us to discuss not only trending or long-standing social justice issues but offer key solutions and call to action prospects for community involvement for greater change. 

I also plan and facilitate the Interfaith Civic Leadership Academy, ICNY’s leadership development programme for diverse faith leaders. It is a programme that offers a cohort of diverse religious leaders the tools they need to work effectively on behalf of their communities. 

Through my work at ICNY, I have had the opportunity to become a trusted source in underrepresented and minority communities. It is through relationship-building that I have had the chance to associate with communities that have long had their doors closed to the outside.

**How did you find ICCS 2022? Were there any lessons or observations that you gleaned from your time in Singapore? What were some interesting anecdotes or highlights you'd like to share?**
 
Attending the ICCS 2022 was an amazing experience; from traveling 19 hours nonstop and landing in a beautiful country to attending an 800+ person conference. It is in fact an experience I still rave about. The people, the food and country were astounding. While attending ICCS 2022, I was lucky enough to meet people from all around the world who are doing very similar work as myself. I must say that my biggest highlight was meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and sharing who I am and the work I do in New York City.

Another highlight worth mentioning is that I was interviewed as a conference attendee and my interview was shared at the end of the conference with the audience. Hearing the cheers and applause brought me tears of immense joy. I am only just some girl from New York City being cheered on for her words and presence and with that, ICCS 2022 was one of the greatest experiences of my life.
