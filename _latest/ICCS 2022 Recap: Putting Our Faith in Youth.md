A key segment of ICCS 2022 was the Young Leaders Programme (YLP), which ran alongside the Main Conference. The YLP served as a platform for young leaders in interfaith engagement from across various regions and backgrounds to network with like-minded delegates, and to present their case studies and novel approaches to fostering social cohesion in their respective communities.

One of the key highlights of this year’s YLP was a special Fireside Chat featuring three content creators: Father Fiel Pareja, a Catholic priest from the Philippines; Reverend Chris Lee, an Anglican priest from the United Kingdom as well as Yasmin Jay, a Muslim-Australian lifestyle and fashion content creator. With a keen eye on the role of technology in empowering social cohesion, the three panellists shared about their journey in harnessing the power of social media to share a message of peace, inclusivity and faith.

The YLP also featured a showcase for innovations by young interfaith leaders to encourage social cohesion. An example was Don Basil Kannangara and his social enterprise, Being Bridges, which rolls out virtual reality (VR) goggles that are programmed to “bring” users on a virtual tour of various houses of worship in Singapore. Created as an educational resource during the pandemic, these VR goggles allow users to better understand a new faith community within the comforts of their own homes.
