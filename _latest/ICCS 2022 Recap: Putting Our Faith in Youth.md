A key segment of ICCS 2022 was the Young Leaders Programme (YLP), which ran alongside the Main Conference. The YLP served as a platform for young leaders in interfaith engagement from across various regions and backgrounds to network with like-minded delegates, and to present their case studies and novel approaches to fostering social cohesion in their respective communities.

One of the key highlights of this yearâ€™s YLP was a special Fireside Chat featuring three content creators: Father Fiel Pareja, a Catholic priest from the Philippines; Reverend Chris Lee, an Anglican priest from the United Kingdom as well as Yasmin Jay, a Muslim-Australian lifestyle and fashion content creator. With a keen eye on the role of technology in empowering social cohesion, the three panellists shared about their journey in harnessing the power of social media to share a message of peace, inclusivity and faith.
