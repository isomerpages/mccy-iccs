For many delegates and speakers, ICCS 2022 was a remarkable experience that introduced new approaches to fostering social cohesion within our communities. There were horizons broadened, friendships forged and experiences gained. One of our delegates was Hanadi Doleh, Director of Community Partnerships at the Interfaith Center of New York (ICNY). She shares more about her personal journey and her takeaways from ICCS 2022:

**As a Muslim American, tell us more about the joys and challenges that come as part of your lived experience.**

I like to think of myself as the quintessential New Yorker: a hijab-wearing, attitude-toting *Brooklynite*, born of Muslim parents who immigrated to America for a better life. I am a product of New York’s melting pot, wearing my heritage and faith proudly. I have spent my adult life working in and for New York’s Muslim community and believe in being the change I want to see. 

As an American Palestinian Muslim woman, I have faced many challenges, particularly after 9/11. I was 16 when the tragedy of 9/11 happened. My life as I knew it changed. My identity became public enemy #1, but it was through the strength of my community and faith that propelled me forward. I will forever be indebted to all the allies who shared this burden with me, who never left me alone, who encouraged me to wear my faith loudly and proudly.

The challenges of being an American Palestinian Muslim woman in a post-9/11 world are vast; they come in spiritual, physical and mental forms. I do not know if I can say I will ever escape them, but I am confident that the diverse community that surrounds me will always hold me close.
