Learning through exploration—that was what teachers in Singapore did last week to enhance their understanding and experience first-hand the country’s religious diversity and harmony.

In a spin-off of the Community Explorations series last seen at the International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS) in September 2022 as well as in the ensuing months, an Educators’ Edition brought groups of enthusiastic educators on learning journeys to twelve places of worship in Singapore, representing six different religions.

This edition was organised by the Character and Citizenship Education Branch of the Ministry of Education (MOE), in partnership with OnePeople.sg and ICCS, as part of the Teachers’ Conference and ExCEL Fest 2023.&nbsp;

ICCS joined the teachers at four of these sites, namely Central Sikh Temple, Khadijah Mosque and Religious Rehabilitation Group, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, and St Joseph’s Church (Victoria Street).

Donning headscarves and bandannas, a group of teachers went on their learning journey at Central Sikh Temple. They learned about the five virtues of the Sikhism belief: Sat (Truth), Santokh (Contentment), Daya (Compassion), Nimrata (Humility) and Pyare (Love). On a tour around the temple, the teachers also witnessed how Sikhs in Singapore practise these virtues in their everyday lives and actions.

As the day’s programme drew to a close, participants sat down with representatives from the Sikh Centre for a Q&amp;A session. Topics explored included the protection of religious rights, the breaking of racial and religious stereotypes, and the common values that connect all religions.
