In the culturally diverse landscape of Singapore, traditions intertwine with modernity, creating a vibrant tapestry of celebrations. The Nine Emperor Gods Festival is a prime example of how Singapore embraces its rich heritage while adapting to the dynamics of the present day. To delve into the heart of this celebration, we’ve had the privilege of speaking with 2 members of the festival’s documentation team: Assistant Professor Koh Keng We, a dedicated assistant professor at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), and Esmond Soh, his former student, now a historian with a deep passion for Chinese religion and society. Their stories not only provide insight into the festival's significance but also inspire us to explore and preserve the cultural treasures within our own communities.

**A Lifelong Promise**

Prof Koh’s fascination with the Nine Emperor Gods Festival was ignited in his childhood when he followed his grandparents and parents to the festival. His grandfather, deeply connected to a Nine Emperor Gods temple, played a significant role in shaping his interest in Chinese religion. He embarked on his academic career with a focus on temples and Chinese religion, conducting research on the festival at the National University of Singapore (NUS). He made a promise to compile a book on the festival, a promise he fulfilled 25 years later when the NHB Heritage and Research Division launched its first Heritage Research Grant in 2014.

Through collaboration with colleagues, graduate students, and various temples, the book on the Nine Emperor Gods Festival in Singapore became a joint effort, reflecting the profound dedication of all involved.
