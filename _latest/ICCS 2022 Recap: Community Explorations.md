<p>A unique element to the ICCS 2022 experience is the Community Exploration
tours. Held each evening during the three-day Conference, the tours took
place following each day’s plenaries and breakout sessions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each tour was centred on a house of worship that holds prominence within
the larger Singaporean community, highlighting its origin story as well
as how the house of worship goes above and beyond in contributing to and
enriching Singapore’s diverse society. Faiths represented in the Community
Exploration tours include Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism,
Taoism and Sikhism.</p>
<p>Participants boarded a bus in the evening from the Raffles City Convention
Centre, where the Main Conference and Young Leaders Programme took place,
taking a journey across Singapore peppered with interesting observations
and anecdotes by an enthusiastic team of local guides. For many of the
delegates visiting from overseas, these rides provided helpful context
for them as they take in the sights and sounds of Singapore.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the house of worship, delegates were brought along an immersive
journey that highlighted how each house of worship came to be and its place
within the wider community today. Often, there were recurring themes underpinning
these origin stories, such as the collective sacrifice and unity displayed
by various communities in coming together to build and consecrate their
houses of worship.</p>

<p>The tours concluded with brief Q&amp;A sessions between the hosts and
visiting delegates. These brief discussions allowed for deeper understanding
of the spotlighted faith. Delegates were then treated with Singapore’s
national pastime: dining out. Delegates were presented with a dizzying
array of diverse culinary offerings at a Singapore hawker centre, thus
bringing the evening’s proceedings to a fulfilling end.</p>
