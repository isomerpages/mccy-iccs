The Main Conference of ICCS 2022 presented a stellar line-up of leaders from policy, faith, community and youth realms, coming together to discuss new trends and approaches to fostering social cohesion within and beyond our communities.

Commencing proceedings was an inspiring speech by Madam Halimah Yacob, President of the Republic of Singapore, as well as a special address by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State of the Holy See.

The three-day Conference also highlighted three plenary discussions, focused on themes such as faith, diversity and technology. It was a treat to hear from luminaries such as Mr Andr√© Azoulay sharing about his upbringing as a Jew in predominantly Muslim Morocco, as well as Dr Shashi Jayakumar highlighting the need for vigilance against online hate speech.
