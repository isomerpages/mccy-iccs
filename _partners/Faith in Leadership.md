Faith in Leadership (FiL) was founded in 2007 to create a diverse family of faith leaders equipped to lead inter and intra-faith initiatives for the benefit of all.

They recognise the immense impact that faith leaders and faith communities have on society, and that quality leadership driven by faithful values is critical to societal and economic flourishing which benefits all people, regardless of faith and cultural background. In short they call this ambition intelligent faith in the public space.

Faith in Leadership is now Britain’s principal leadership development organisation for our faith communities. Incubated at the University of Cambridge Divinity School and currently based at St Benet’s Hall, Oxford University, Faith in Leadership runs a range of residential and day programmes for senior faith leaders, lay leaders and young people.
