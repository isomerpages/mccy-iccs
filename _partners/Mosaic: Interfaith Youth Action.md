Mosaic: Interfaith Youth Action is a nonprofit organization that empowers the youth of Boston and the surrounding areas to gain the skills to bridge divides, better enabling them to work collaboratively to create a just and peaceful society. 

These skills such as leadership, empathy, active listening, and nonviolent communication are developed through an interfaith lens and give the youth the ability to become agents of change in addressing virtually any of the challenging situations that society faces today.

Mosaic: Interfaith Youth Action achieves this by developing engaging and exciting programming focused on the creation of meaningful interfaith experiences for young people, which empower them to build a more just, equitable, and peaceful society.
