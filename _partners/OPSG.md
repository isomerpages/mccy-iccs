Established in 1997 as Central Singapore Joint Social Service Centre, OnePeople.sg (OPSG) was repositioned and launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in 2007 to champion racial harmony initiatives in Singapore. Since its inception, OPSG has played an instrumental role promoting racial harmony from a ground up perspective. OPSGâ€™s efforts seek to deepen and broaden engagement with youths, stakeholders and the wider community engaging various sectors of society.

OPSG serves as the voice and advocate for multiracialism being collaborative in our approach, encouraging respectful dialogue as a means to address racial faultlines in our society. OPSG serves as a safe space for engagement of difficult issues bringing forth community concerns and aspirations; widening common space and nurturing advocates for the cause. OPSG seeks to be a positive influence by providing views on key policy issues and responding to incidents which impact our social fabric.

OPSG is a partnership of founding partners and institutions which come together across racial and organisational lines for the larger goal of social cohesion. OPSG also works closely with various religious organisations, community stakeholders, government agencies and individuals to reach out and pursue the development of deeper racial harmony in Singapore.
