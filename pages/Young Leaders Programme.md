The Young Leaders Programme (YLP) is a platform for young local and international leaders to network and collaborate on initiatives to strengthen social cohesion. The YLP aims to develop a core of young leaders who can speak and lead with confidence on issues affecting ethnic and religious harmony today.

This year, Singapore is proud to welcome some 120 young leaders actively involved in or are leading interfaith and community-building efforts.

From 6th-8th September 2022, delegates can look forward to:

* **Small group discussions** around contemporary issues of faith and identity;

* **A hands-on, experiential showcase** of ground-up projects to strengthen social cohesion; and

* **A capability-building workshop** to equip and inspire young civic leaders.
