<p>Organised in conjunction with the ICCS, the Young Leaders Programme (YLP)
is a dynamic platform for the emerging local and international leaders
to network, ideate and collaborate on initiatives that strengthen social
cohesion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The YLP connects young leaders from Southeast Asia and beyond, fostering
a vibrant community where ideas are shared, skills are honed, and confidence
is built to address social cohesion challenges. YLP harnesses the energy
and creativity of youth to drive practical solutions and contribute meaningfully
to building a more cohesive and resilient society.</p>
