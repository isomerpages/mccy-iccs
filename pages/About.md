The International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS) was held in Singapore in June 2019 to discuss the strengthening of cohesive societies and interfaith harmony. First mooted by President Halimah Yacob in May 2018, the Conference brought together 1,100 international thought leaders across academia, government, religious groups, and civil society from 40 countries. The ICCS was organized by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, with the support of the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY).
