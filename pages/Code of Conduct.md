# Purpose

The ICCS Secretariat is committed to enabling events at which everyone can participate in an inclusive, respectful, and safe environment.

ICCS is guided by the highest ethical and professional standards, and all participants are expected to behave with integrity and respect towards all participants attending or involved with any ICCS event.

# Applicability

The Code of Conduct applies to any ICCS event, which shall include meetings, symposia, assemblies, receptions, scientific and technical events, expert meetings, workshops, exhibits, side events and any other forum organizsed, hosted, or sponsored in whole or part by the ICCS wherever it takes place, and any event or gathering that takes place on ICCS premises whether the ICCS Secretariat is organizsing, hosting, or sponsoring. All speakers, moderators, sponsors, attendees and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

The Code of Conduct applies to all participants at the ICCS event, including all persons attending or involved in any capacity in the ICCS event.

The ICCS Secretariat commits to implementing the Code of Conduct.

The Code of Conduct is not legal or prescriptive in nature. It supplements, and does not affect, the application of other relevant policies, regulations, rules, and laws, including laws regulating the premises in which the ICCS event takes place.

# Prohibited conduct

Harassment is any improper or unwelcome conduct that might be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation to another person. Harassment in any form because of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, physical ability, physical appearance, ethnicity, race, national origin, political affiliation, age, religion, or any other reason is prohibited at ICCS events.

Harassment may involve any conduct of a verbal, nonverbal or physical nature, including written and electronic communications, and may occur between persons of the same or different genders.

The ICCS Secretariat will take any reasonable appropriate action needed to prevent and respond to retaliation, in accordance with its applicable policy, regulations and rules.
