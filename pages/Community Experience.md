<p>The Community Experience is an immersive programme that gives local and
international delegates a firsthand look at Singapore’s approach to multicultural
and interreligious harmony. By engaging with local communities and exploring
Singapore’s diverse neighborhoods, delegates gain invaluable insights into
real-world social cohesion. Typically held each evening after plenaries
and breakout sessions, these sessions showcase how shared experiences foster
harmony in diversity.</p>
