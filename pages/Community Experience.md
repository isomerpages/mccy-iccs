<p>The Community Experience is an immersive programme that gives local and
international delegates a firsthand look at Singapore’s approach to multicultural
and interreligious harmony. By engaging with local communities and exploring
Singapore’s diverse neighborhoods, delegates will gain invaluable insights
into how social cohesion is fostered and how diverse faith and cultural
practices enrich life in a vibrant, multicultural society. Typically held
each evening after each day’s conference proceedings, these sessions showcase
how shared experiences foster harmony in diversity.</p>
