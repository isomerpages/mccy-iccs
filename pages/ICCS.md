<h2>About ICCS 2025</h2>
<p>In an era marked by growing interconnectedness yet increasing division,
what unites us? How can diverse communities build bonds that endure the
challenges of our time?</p>
<p>Mooted by Former President Halimah Yacob and inaugurated in 2019, the
International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS) has led the conversation
on interfaith and multicultural dialogue, proving that unity can flourish
even in a divided world.</p>
<p>Now in its third edition, ICCS 2025 adopts the theme <strong>“Cohesive Societies, Resilient Futures,”</strong> sparking
fresh conversations on multiculturalism and the ingredients of harmony
in diversity amid an increasingly divided world. ICCS 2025 brings together
global thought leaders, policymakers, community practitioners and young
leaders to exchange ideas, share best practices, and develop innovative
solutions to inspire cohesive and resilient multicultural societies worldwide.</p>
<p>Join us at ICCS 2025 as we pave the way for a more cohesive, resilient
future—both in Singapore and around the globe. Follow ICCS socials for
