We have many identities. Faith, ethnicity, culture, nationality – all intertwining and defining us as individuals. How can we unite despite our differences? How do we form bonds and bridge divides?

It is a pivotal time for conversations, as the world emerges from a pandemic where polarisation and social isolation have come to the fore. Through the theme ***“Confident Identities, Connected Communities”***, The International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS) 2022 will set the stage for the world to re-examine our multiple identities and the connections with our communities, covering the key aspects of faith, identity and cohesion.

We will also cast a spotlight on youth as future leaders in an increasingly digitalised world and their immensely important role in fostering social cohesion.

The ICCS is the preeminent event for interfaith and multicultural dialogue. Mooted by President of Singapore Halimah Yacob, the Conference was held in Singapore for the first time in 2019, showcasing the tropical island-state’s unique approach to managing communal ties within a diverse population. It is organised by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) and supported by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY).
