<h2>About ICCS 2025</h2>
<p>In an era marked by growing interconnectedness yet increasing division,
what unites us and gives us hope and confidence for the future? How can
diverse communities build bonds that endure the challenges of our time?</p>
<p>Mooted by former President of Singapore Halimah Yacob and inaugurated
in 2019, the International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS) has
led the conversation on interfaith and multicultural dialogue, demonstrating
that unity can flourish even in a divided world. More than 2200 participants
from over 40 countries have attended ICCS and its programmes since its
inception.</p>
<p>Now in its third edition, ICCS 2025 adopts the theme <strong>“Cohesive Societies, Resilient Futures,”</strong> sparking
fresh conversations on multiculturalism and the foundations of harmony
in diversity. This edition will delve into three thematic pillars—<strong>Unpacking Multiculturalism, Navigating Uncertainty,</strong> and <strong>Forging Societal Resilience</strong>—through
inspiring plenaries, breakout sessions, and skills workshops that equip
delegates with actionable insights.</p>
<p>Held in Singapore, one of the world’s most religiously diverse countries,
ICCS brings together global thought leaders, policymakers, community practitioners
and young leaders to exchange ideas, share best practices, and develop
innovative solutions for cohesive and resilient multicultural societies
worldwide. As Singapore celebrates its 60th year of independence in 2025,
ICCS stands as a powerful reminder that our shared humanity can overcome
division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us at ICCS 2025 as we pave the way for a more cohesive and resilient
future—both in Singapore and around the globe.</p>
