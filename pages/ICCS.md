The International Conference on Cohesive Societies (ICCS) is the preeminent event for interfaith and multicultural dialogue. Mooted by President of Singapore Halimah Yacob, the Conference was held in Singapore for the first time in 2019, showcasing the tropical island-state’s unique approach to managing communal ties within a diverse population. It is organised by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) and supported by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY).

As the world emerges from the pandemic, our theme for ICCS 2022 is ***“Confident Identities, Connected Communities”***. Through this Conference, we seek to examine the role of our identities in compelling each of us to reconnect with our wider communities, touching on key aspects such as faith, identity and cohesion. Forged in crisis, our renewed sense of purpose and resilience will set the tone as we reach out to one another in a post-pandemic world.

We will also cast a spotlight on youth as future leaders in an increasingly digitalised world and their immensely important role in fostering social cohesion.
