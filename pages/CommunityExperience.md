The Community Experience is an immersive programme and will provide local and foreign delegates participating in ICCS 2022 an opportunity to experience first-hand the manifestation of Singapore’s interracial and interreligious harmony policies, through interacting with our local community partners.

This progamme will comprise a heartland dialogue and various activities, providing safe platforms for potential cross-sector collaborations, robust discourse, and rich community reflections on the key pillars of ICCS. Activities include: 

•	**Community Explorations** to deepen intercultural understanding and facilitate interpersonal exchange on key tenets, value systems, and socio norms of our diverse cultural and religious landscape. 

•	**Community Dialogue** in partnership with key stakeholders on interethnic and interfaith efforts, to explore issues of identity, multiculturalism and interreligious constructs in building cohesive societies.
