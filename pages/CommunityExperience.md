The Community Experience is an immersive programme and will provide local and foreign delegates participating in ICCS 2022 an opportunity to experience first-hand the manifestation of Singapore’s interracial and interreligious harmony policies, through interacting with our local community partners.

This programme will comprise a heartland dialogue and various activities, providing safe platforms for potential cross-sector collaborations, robust discourse and rich community reflections on the key pillars of ICCS. Activities include: 

•	**Community Explorations**: Through visits to places of worship around Singapore, participants will have the opportunity to deepen intercultural understanding, and discuss the value systems and socio norms of Singapore's diverse cultural and religious landscape.
