The Community Experience is an immersive programme and will provide local and foreign delegates an opportunity to experience first-hand the manifestation of Singapore’s inter-racial and inter-religious harmony policies, through interacting with our local community partners.

This progamme will comprise heartland dialogue and experiences, providing safe platforms for potential cross-sector collaborations, robust discourse, and rich community reflections on the key pillars of ICCS. Activities include: 

•	Community Explorations to deepen intercultural understanding and facilitate interpersonal exchange on key tenets, value systems, and socio norms of our diverse cultural and religious landscape. 

•	Community Dialogue in partnership with key stakeholders on interethnic and / interfaith efforts to explore issues of identity, multiculturalism, and interreligious constructs in building cohesive societies.
