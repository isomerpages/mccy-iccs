Building on the outcomes of the inaugural ICCS in 2019, and to enrich discussions at the second edition of the ICCS, RSIS is launching a research study on social cohesion.

The study titled **“Southeast Asian Social Cohesion Radar 2022”** seeks to understand localised experiences of social cohesion and identity, and analyse the factors and environment that make societies in ASEAN Member States cohesive. 

In the run-up to the launch of the research study, we will be conducting a workshop to review the findings of the study and to understand the thoughts and views of a selected number of experts who are deeply involved in the vital task of building understanding and coexistence in communities around the world.
