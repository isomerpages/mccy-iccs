The ICCS research stream is a new and signature component of the ICCS, which includes three parts.

**1. Regional survey** - to foster more evidence-based discussions around the themes of ICCS. The findings will be discussed through an academic-focused research symposium on 1 July 2022. The survey will provide cross-country findings on social cohesion in the region and give insight into the core elements of social cohesion.

**2. Commentary series** - comprising articles discussing issues relevant to ICCS and published on RSIS’ website. The commentaries are written by a mix of academics, youths and community practitioners, for a wide range of views and expertise.
* Towards ICCS 2022 – Buddhist Diplomacy: Potential for Regional Cohesion, Jack Meng-Tat Chia, 10 May 2022
* Towards ICCS 2022 – Coexisting with Diversity and Differences, Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, 21 April 2022
* Towards ICCS 2022 – Repairing the World: Faith Against Online Hate, Yudit Greenberg, 22 March 2022

**3. Post-conference book** - similar to the ICCS 2019 book, this book will capture main insights and speeches from the conference.
