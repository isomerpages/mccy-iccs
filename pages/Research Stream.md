The ICCS research stream is a new and signature component of the ICCS, which includes three parts.

**1. Regional survey** - to foster more evidence-based discussions around the themes of ICCS. The findings will be discussed through an academic-focused research symposium on 1 July 2022. The survey will provide cross-country findings on social cohesion in the region and give insight into the core elements of social cohesion.

**2. Commentary series** - comprising articles discussing issues relevant to ICCS and published on RSIS’ website. The commentaries are written by a mix of academics, youths and community practitioners, for a wide range of views and expertise. Links to read the commentaries:
