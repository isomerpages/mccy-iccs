The ICCS research stream is a new and signature component of the ICCS, which includes three separate parts.

The first part is a regional survey which will foster more evidence-based discussions revolving around the themes of ICCS. The findings will be discussed through an academic-focused research symposium on 1 July 2022. The survey will provide cross-country findings on social cohesion in the region and give insight into the core elements which social cohesion is composed of.

The second part of the research stream is a commentary series which comprises articles discussing issues relevant to ICCS and published on RSISâ€™ website. The commentaries are written by a mix of academics, youths and community practitioners, for a wide range of views and expertise. 

The third part of the series is a post-conference book. Similar to the ICCS 2019 book, this book will capture main insights and speeches from the conference.
