The ICCS research series is a new and signature component of the ICCS, which includes three separate parts.

The first part is a regional survey which will foster more evidence-based discussions revolving around the themes of ICCS. The findings will be discussed through an academic-focused research symposium in June. The survey will provide cross-country findings on social cohesion in the region and give insight into the core elements which social cohesion is composed of.

The second part of the research series is a commentary series which comprises articles discussing issues relevant to ICCS and published on RSISâ€™ website. The commentaries are written by a mix of academics, youths and community practitioners, for a wide range of views and expertise. 

The third part of the series is a pre-conference reading package which will showcase work already published by practitioners, academics, and youth who will speak at and attend ICCS 2022. This will form a set of pre-conference reading materials that will aid further and deeper discussions during the Conference. Topics will cover a wide range of perspectives pertaining to the three broad themes of Faith, Identity and Cohesion.
