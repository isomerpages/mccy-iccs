<p>ICCS 2025 offers the following breakout sessions that feature in-depth
discussions on aspects across the three pillars.</p>
<h4><strong>Breakout 1: Is history a compass for navigation or a barrier to a more inclusive futures?</strong></h4>
<p>People from diverse communities have interacted with one another since
human civilisations. The long, shared history however does not always progress
to having a better understanding between sectarian groups. In periods of
economic uncertainties and rapid changes, some societies have fractured
along racial and religious lines, while others have flourished through
shared values and mutually agreed ways of life. This session will discuss
how nations can anchor on common national legacies for the future, and
what are the conditions that have enabled multicultural societies to be
optimistic and cohesive.</p>

and connected world? What kind of social compact is needed to bring state,
institutions, and sectarian groups together? How may we build multi-ethnic
cohesion and ensure every community thrive in-spite of cultural, religious,
and economic differences? This session will explore perspectives on creating
environments that promote inclusion, trust, and collective well-being.</p>

<h4><strong>Breakout 4: Fostering a Resilient Digital Eco-System in a Multicultural Society</strong></h4>
<p>Rapid technological advancements have given rise to unique challenges
and opportunities to strengthening our multi-ethnic and multi-religious
fabric. While the advent of artificial intelligence and social media platforms
have contributed to cyber harms in the form of misinformation, deep fake,
and digital abuse, there is also evidence that its potential can be harnessed
to grow of a stronger, more resilient society. This session brings together
speakers who understand how technology can elevate social trust and expand
future possibilities for all.</p>

<h4><strong>Breakout 5: Revamping cultural and social institutions to engage new cultural identities</strong></h4>

cultural clusters are emerging, and their distinct identities have challenged
the dynamics between communities, heritage maintenance, and our sense of
belonging to the broader society and country. The speakers will examine

do we engage the new groups and navigate the cultural sensitivities.</p>

together. It is also about appreciating and embracing the ambivalence of
diversity, identifying what are the shared rituals, and agreeing on what
should be the way of life for all. This session explores how mutual understanding

be forged with simple gestures and day to day activities.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Breakout 8: Rebuilding trust and cohesion after social tragedies</strong></h4>
<p>Natural and man-made disasters have a long and deep impact on the psychological
and communal fabric of a society. This challenge is more acute in a diverse
society where the quality of multicultural contact and trust form the bedrock
of stability. As such, post-crises management and the successful rebuilding
of societies are vital to uplift and maintain cohesive and resilient societies
in the face of devastations. This session examines the multifaceted approach
to rebuilding trust after crisis recovery.</p>
