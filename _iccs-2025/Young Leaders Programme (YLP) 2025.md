<p>Organised in conjunction with the ICCS, the Young Leaders Programme (YLP)
is a dynamic platform for the emerging local and international leaders
to network, ideate and collaborate on initiatives that strengthen social
cohesion.&nbsp; The YLP connects young leaders from Southeast Asia and
beyond, fostering a vibrant community where ideas are shared, skills are
honed, and confidence is built to address social cohesion challenges. YLP
harnesses the energy and creativity of youth to drive practical solutions
and contribute meaningfully to building a more cohesive and resilient society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YLP 2025 will focus on experiential and interactive learning sessions
where youths across the world get to exchange unique cultures, share fresh
perspectives, and ideate innovative approaches to foster cohesion and harmony.
Through working with select youth alumni as part of the YLP 2025 Working
Committee and involving YLP delegates as co-creators of the programme,
we also support youth leadership and their development.</p>

<h4><strong>Experiential Learning &amp; Applied Learning</strong></h4>
<p>YLPâ€™s experiential learning programmes like interactive theatre and YLP
Working Comm-led breakout activities immerse delegates in real-world scenarios,
turning theory into practice. Through hands-on activities, delegates will
gain practical insights and develop critical problem-solving skills. The
closing workshop will help bridge the gap between knowledge &amp; skillsets
gleaned across the whole conference and actual practices, helping YLP delegates
connect classroom concepts with real-world applications.</p>

<h4><strong>Cultural Exchange and Ideation Opportunities</strong></h4>
<p>Join us for a vibrant evening where cultures converge and connect! This
unique networking event brings together international delegates for an
enriching experience of cultural exchange and showcase. We have also carved
out a slot for delegates to transform inspiration into action through our
brainstorming session where delegates will get to collaborate in teams,
share diverse perspectives on fostering harmony and develop practical,
innovative ideas for community engagement and create actionable plans for
cultural bridge-building.</p>

<h4><strong>Inclusive and Participatory Model</strong></h4>
<p>Leadership is best cultivated when as many voices as possible are heard.&nbsp;
YLP strives to include youth delegates not just as participants, but as
co-creators of the experience. This inclusive approach ensures that the
delegates can contribute, learn, and grow as part of a diverse and vibrant
community. You will find friendly YLP 2025 Working Committee members as
your fellow youth delegates who have curated fun breakout activities for
your participation.</p>
