<p>Organised in conjunction with the ICCS, the Young Leaders Programme (YLP)
is a dynamic platform for the emerging local and international leaders
to network, ideate and collaborate on initiatives that strengthen social
cohesion.&nbsp; The YLP connects young leaders from Southeast Asia and
beyond, fostering a vibrant community where ideas are shared, skills are
honed, and confidence is built to address social cohesion challenges. YLP
harnesses the energy and creativity of youth to drive practical solutions
and contribute meaningfully to building a more cohesive and resilient society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YLP 2025 will focus on experiential and interactive learning sessions
where youths across the world get to exchange unique cultures, share fresh
perspectives, and ideate innovative approaches to foster cohesion and harmony.
Through working with select youth alumni as part of the YLP 2025 Working
Committee and involving YLP delegates as co-creators of the programme,
we also support youth leadership and their development.</p>
