<p>At ICCS 2025, we are excited to offer a series of interactive skills workshops
designed to equip participants with the tools to foster understanding,
build trust, and navigate the complexities of today’s diverse world. These
workshops reflect our shared commitment to building societies that are
not only resilient but also empathetic, forward-looking, and united in
diversity.</p>
<p>Participants will explore critical topics such as:</p>
