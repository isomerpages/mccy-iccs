<p>ICCS 2025 will feature new sharing sessions that provide an open platform
for delegates to engage in meaningful discussions on issues that resonate
deeply within their communities. Organised thematically and facilitated
by a subject expert, the sessions encourage candid conversations, the exchange
of diverse perspectives, and the co-creation of actionable ideas.</p>
<h4><strong>1. Conversing Better: Broadening and Fostering Inclusive Dialogue</strong></h4>
<p>In a world that is becomingly increasingly polarised, the importance of
dialogue in bridging differences cannot be understated.&nbsp;This session
seeks to explore ways in which dialogue can be made more inclusive. Specifically,
delegates are encouraged to discuss how we might engage more communities,
such as the non-religious. Delegates can also reflect upon and discuss
norms that can facilitate healthy and open&nbsp;dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitator</strong>: <strong>Mr Mohamed Imran Mohamed Taib</strong>,
Director, Dialogue Centre</p>
<h4><strong>2. Enhancing Outreach: Educating and Rallying For Good</strong></h4>
<p>Good causes can go further and achieve more when it is amplified and awareness
is effectively raised. Educating and rallying others can encourage more&nbsp;to
participate in the cause and&nbsp;galvanise meaningful change.&nbsp;This
session explores the best practices for outreach across&nbsp;platforms
and audience segments.&nbsp;By the end of the session, it is hoped that
delegates will be inspired to augment their outreach efforts to reach a
wider audience and&nbsp;boost the impact of their existing work.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitator</strong>: <strong>Dr William Wan</strong>, Managing
Director, Fervent Chambers</p>
<h4><strong>3. Moderating Conversations on Social Media</strong></h4>
<p>With the surge of conversations online, especially on social media, there
is greater risk of misunderstandings that may extend to inter-group tensions.
This session will explore how individuals and organisations can respond
effectively to such conversations, especially when encountering differing
opinions and viewpoints. Delegates will have the opportunity to discuss
strategies and opportunities for moderating uncomfortable interactions
online, especially on social media, preventing escalation, and maintaining
a respectful environment that minimises harm to communities.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitator</strong>: <strong>Mr Malminderjit Singh</strong>, Chair,
Sikh Advisory Board</p>
<h4><strong>4. Uplifting Spirits: Recovery, Remembrance and Resilience</strong></h4>
<p>While building social cohesion is crucial to preventing conflicts, some
challenges, such as volatile geopolitical environments and natural disasters,
are beyond our control. Recovery goes beyond providing immediate assistance;
it also involves rebuilding and restoring the spirits of affected communities.
This can include honouring the memory of those who have suffered or uplifting
those affected through arts and sports. This session offers delegates a
platform to discuss how uplifting spirits, remembrance, and positive storytelling
play vital roles in recovery and social cohesion in difficult times.</p>
